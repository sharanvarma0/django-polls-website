Polls
-----

This is a django project which I did to learn about django. This is a website that can be used to conduct live
polls. The polls are defined in the admin page (/admin). Then, we can visit the polls (/polls) page to vote on
an answer.

The admin dashboard receives the results and collates it. 

Still some work left like documentation. However, it has been packaged complete with files like MANIFEST and LICENSE.
